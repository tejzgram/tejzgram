## 📈 My Analytics Philosophy

> **"Data doesn't matter until it changes decisions."**

I believe in:
1. **Business-First Approach:** Start with the business problem, not the data
2. **Clean Before Analysis:** Garbage in = garbage out (rigorous data validation)
3. **Storytelling with Data:** Insights must be communicated clearly to non-technical stakeholders
4. **Impact Measurement:** Every analysis should show ROI or tangible improvement
